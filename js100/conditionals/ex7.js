// Predict the output of the following code:

if (false || true) {
  console.log('yes..!');
} else {
  console.log('no');
}

/*
Prediction is that is will console yes even though the first conditional is fasle, it is followed with an or || conditonal that is true. So the true makes the conditional truthy
