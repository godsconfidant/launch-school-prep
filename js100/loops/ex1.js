//  Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?

// this should return 6 numbers. index starts at 0 and ends at 10 counting by twos 

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
