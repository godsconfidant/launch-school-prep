// The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) Why is that? Also modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.

/*
for (let i = 0; ;i += 1) {
  console.log('on and on');

  --- adding a break statement will also stop loop, but will do so on first iteration; ----
}



This will keep looping because it does not have a conditional that tell is when to stop loopoing;
   (i < someNumber;) will stop the loop when it reaches that number on increments;
   (i > someNumber;) will stop the loop when in reaches that number on decrements;
