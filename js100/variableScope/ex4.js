// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a)
  }
}

myFunction();

// Yes. This code will OUTPUT the value of a to the console. It will RETURN nothing as there is no return statement and we are not trying to console.log the call statement. 

// Also NOTE: Variables declared in an outer statement can be accessed be inner statements.
