// Without looking into your notes, try to remember which primitive data types are defined in JavaScript. Then find this information on MDN.

/*
Primitive data types:

1: strings
2: numbers:
3: boolean:
4: undefined:
5: null: 
6: bigint         bigint not bigO
7: symbol 

got #6 wrong/ put bigO not bigint.  Maybe actually using the last two will make it stick better.
