// Let's generalize the function from the previous exercise a bit. Implement a function cite that takes two string arguments: the author of the quote and what they said. It then logs the quote to the console, as in the following example.


function cite(param1, param2) {
  console.log(`${param1} said: "${param2}"`);
};


cite('Rich H', 'Always bet on Javascript');
