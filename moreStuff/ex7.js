// What is excetion handling and what problem does it solve.

/* Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a predictable fashion.
  It uses  try  catch   finally    to look for potential problems in the code and tells javascript how to handle the error ie console.log(error) so that the program can keep running around the error and we know what the error is so we can decide what to do with it(the error)
